# CMPT370_FProject

This was the final project for MacEwan Universities Introduction to Computer Graphics course instructed by Dr. Dana Cobzas during the fall semester of 2021.
It was a group project consisting of myself and Zheyuan Xu. The project utilized WebGL with a custom game engine library created by MacEwan Alumni Zachary Swensrude.

To start the game run `server.py` in the console and it will open up a new tab at the access port.
