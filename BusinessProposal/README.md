## TruNorth Survival Solutions - First Aid Kit
This is the group project for MacEwan University's Introduction to Sustainable Business course instructed by Dr. Sergey Sukhankin during the fall semester of 2023.

As the course did not have any prerequisites students from other programs could attend. Our group involved 8 people from a variety of backgrounds including; english majors, engineers and business students who required the course.

During the project I entered into a management position. We communicated through discord, and our working documents where shared through a google drive server. When Dr. Sukhankin would post the worksheets involved in the process of our business proposal I would create the initial document and copy the requirements and layout.

Throughout our project I refined my skills working with a larger team, ensuring every voice could be heard with regard to our given time limit. I also checked if everyone was contributing in some manner, and if a group member was silent for a long period of time and we could not contact them they would be removed from the group.
